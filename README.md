Quantitative Methodology: Regime-Based Factor Rotation
This document outlines the formal mathematical framework used to categorize economic environments, evaluate stock performance, and manage risk within the S&P 500 Regime Strategy.
1. Economic Regime Classification
The strategy identifies market cycles by comparing current macroeconomic indicators against their historical averages via Simple Moving Averages (SMA).
Indicator Definitions
Let IR_t be the Effective Federal Funds Rate and BS_t be the Federal Reserve Total Assets (Balance Sheet) at time t.
1. Rate Trend (T_{IR}) Determined by a 26-week (6-month) SMA:
2. Liquidity Trend (T_{BS}) Determined by a 52-week (1-year) SMA:
Regime Matrix
The interaction of these two binary states defines the four specific strategy regimes:
| Regime | Rate Trend | Liquidity Trend | Economic Context | Primary Factor Focus |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | Low | Expansion | Liquidity Injection / "Easy Money" | Growth (Z_g) |
| B | Low | Contraction | Transition / Neutral | Balanced (Z_g + Z_p) |
| C | High | Expansion | Inflationary / Overheating | Balanced (Z_g + Z_p) |
| D | High | Contraction | Tightening / "Risk-Off" | Profitability (Z_p) |
2. Factor Normalization (Cross-Sectional Z-Scores)
To ensure that disparate units (percentages for growth vs. ratios for profit) are mathematically comparable, we apply cross-sectional Z-score normalization across the universe U.
For a specific attribute x (e.g., Revenue Growth) of stock i:
Where:
 * \mu_x = \frac{1}{|U|} \sum_{j \in U} x_j (Universe Mean)
 * \sigma_x = \sqrt{\frac{1}{|U|} \sum_{j \in U} (x_j - \mu_x)^2} (Universe Standard Deviation)
3. Factor Scoring Engine
The final score S_i for each security is a weighted combination of its Growth Score (Z_{i,g}) and Profitability Score (Z_{i,p}):
Regime-Dependent Weighting (w)
The weights shift to prioritize specific corporate characteristics based on the identified macro regime:
 * Regime A: w_g = 1.0, w_p = 0.0
 * Regime D: w_g = 0.0, w_p = 1.0
 * Regimes B & C: w_g = 0.5, w_p = 0.5
4. Portfolio Construction
The strategy maintains a Market Neutral posture through a Long/Short structure to isolate factor returns from broad market direction.
 * Selection Logic:
   *    *  * Weighting Schema:
   * For each stock j in Long basket L, weight w_j = \frac{0.5}{N}
   * For each stock j in Short basket S, weight w_j = -\frac{0.5}{N}
 * Exposure Profile:
   * Gross Exposure: \sum |w_j| = 1.0 (100%)
   * Net Exposure: \sum w_j = 0.0 (0%)
5. Risk and Return Attribution
Individual Position Return (R_j)
 * Long Positions: R_j = \frac{P_{current} - P_{entry}}{P_{entry}}
 * Short Positions: R_j = \frac{P_{entry} - P_{current}}{P_{entry}}
Trailing Stop-Loss (SL)
The strategy tracks the "Extreme Price" (P_{ext}), defined as the peak for longs or trough for shorts.
 * Profit Threshold: Trailing stop activates when R_j > 20\%.
 * Exit Condition: If active, exit the position if P_{current} retraces 10\% from P_{ext}.
